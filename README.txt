METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION

1. Description of methods used for collection/generation of data: The Environment for the Analysis of Geo-Located Energy Information (EAGLE-I) is maintained at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) for the Department of Energy (DOE). EAGLE-I is DOE’s operational and scalable data and information platform for real-time wide-area situational awareness of the energy sector, providing a centralized platform for monitoring power distribution outage for the US and Territories. This data has been collected from electric utility’s public outage maps using an ETL process.

2. Methods for processing the data: Data has been aggregated to the county level for the dissemination of the dataset.

3. Instrument- or software-specific information needed to interpret the data: N/A 

4. Standards and calibration information, if appropriate: N/A 

5. Environmental/experimental conditions: N/A 

6. Describe any quality-assurance procedures performed on the data: Our coverage numbers are updated annually using the EIA-861 dataset. The EAGLE-I team daily monitors for parser errors to ensure the accuracy of our collected outage numbers, issuing releases twice a week or more as needed to maintain our system.

7. People involved with sample collection, processing, analysis and/or submission: Varisara Tansakul, Aaron Myers, Sarah Tennille, Matthew Denman, Alec Hamaker, Jonathan Huihui, Kyle Medlen, Karl Allen, Daniel Redmon, Supriya Chinthavali, Mark Colleti, Joshua Grant, Matt Lee, Dakotah Maguire, Scott Newby, Chelsey Stahl, Budhu Bhaduri, Jibo Sanyal


DATA-SPECIFIC INFORMATION FOR: EAGLEI_Metadata.doc

1. Number of variables: N/A

2. Number of cases/rows: N/A

3. Variable List: N/A

4. Missing data codes: N/A

5. Specialized formats or other abbreviations used: N/A
